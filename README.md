# user-dashboard


## My goal when designing this application was to make it efficient and able to have testing implemented later on. With that said, here are a few things I would like to add or change.

- Add a dynamic route to the router in client for profile views.
- implement/create a middleware called axiosWithAuth in client to simplify api calls.
- Implemet mixins and centralize shared styles, or replace them with an external styling library.

## This project pushed my current limits and required me to dig deep into a lot of documentation, and I enjoyed it!
